# Introduction to Java

In this section you will find a number of simple examples, that will introduce the Java programming language.

## Example list

### Controlling what's happening
This example demonstrate some of Java's features, to make decisions and control your program's flow. Execute the following commands:
```bash
    cd control
    mvn clean package
    java -jar target/control.jar
```

#### Tasks
 * Run app and test with various inputs
 * add a switch case to input method, selecting numbers 1,2,3
 * write four methods one for each above switch cases and one for default
 * modify the method for three that outputs 10 times a message
 * 

### On data types
Storing data in variables is essential for any programming language. This example provides help, to understand Java's build-in types and how you use them.
```bash
    cd data
    mvn clean package
    java -jar target/data.jar
```

#### Tasks
 * Run app
 * Write a method, that creates StringBuffer output with separating all values
 * Write a method, that in/decreases all integer types to its respective maximum/minimum
 * Enhance calculating method by all [arithmetic operators](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_operators.asp)
